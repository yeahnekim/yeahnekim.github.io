						<h3> About </h3>
						Hi there! I am Lydia, and I am originally from Changwon, S. Korea, and I came to the US at 16. I experienced and learned various
						cultures, people, and lifestyles moving around in the US and Korea: I've been to Changwon, Busan, A-san, Jeju Island, Miryang, 
						Yangsan in South Korea and also lived in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Massachusetts (USA).
						Currently, I reside in Amherst, MA.
						<br> I am a Ph.D student who loves traveling, cooking, reading, and challenging new things I have no experience with. <br>
						Also, I am a math-lover who loves puzzles and Sudoku! =) <br>
						I studied Computer Science and Mathematics in <a
							href=https://www.mtholyoke.edu>college</a>, and I am an Mechanical & Industrial Engineering/Operations Research (I.E.O.R.)
						 Ph.D. student at UMass Amherst beginning in Fall 2024. <br>
					
						<b>My Favorite TV Show & Movies: </b> "Jack Ryan" on Amazon Prime, "Hospital Playlist" on Netfix<br>
						<b>My Favorite Book: </b>"Weapons of Math Destructions" by Cathy O'Neil, "Who Moved My
						Cheese?" by Spencer Johnson <br>

										<h3> Notable Projects 📝 </h3>
										<h4>Development of a Recidivism Predicting Model with Lasso Logistic Regression
										</h4>
										COMSC335 Machine Learning, Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA
										<li> Built a recidivism-predicting model using logistic regression, a machine
											learning technique, to predict binary recidivism outcomes. Employed
											collaborative data processing, feature selection, regularizations, and
											hyperparameter tuning alongside two classmates </li> <br>

										<h4>Pulmonary Severity Assessment of Radiography by Artificial Intelligence</h4>
										Veytel.LLC, Pittsburgh, PA
										<li> Implemented an automated severity scoring system of Chest X-Rays to
											diagnose ARDS and Covid-19 in the software engineering internship at Veytel.
											LLC </li>
										<br>

										<h4> University Professor Wage Analysis</h4>
										STAT242 Intermediate Statistics, Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA
										<li> Investigated factors influencing professor wages using data visualizing
											tools in R Studio and an open-source dataset, collaborating with classmates
											to build and refine a predictive model using mixed-effect linear regression.
										</li>

											<h3> 🌱 Productivity Hacks in My Life 🌱 </h3> <br>
											<li> <b>Regular Sleep Schedule 12 - 6 AM:</b> After a short reflection on how I
												spent the day and tomorrow's plan, I try to go to bed no later than
												midnight for the next day :) </li> <br>
											<li> <b>Morning Exercise: </b> Kicking off a day with a workout refreshes my
												brain and fills me with energy and enthusiasm to tackle the day. </li> <br>
											<li> <b>Me-Time Morning: </b> After the workout, I usually spend 2-3 hours
												in the morning tackling the most complicated tasks (i.e., solving math
												proofs). However, twice a week, with my favorite cup of
												cappuccino from my Nespresso machine, I use this 2-hour morning time
												block for reading books, solving puzzles, or listening to interesting
												podcasts away from my To-do lists and all the assignments.<br> <br>
												<b>Hobbies:</b> Yoga, Weight Training, Cooking, Reading, Traveling <br>
