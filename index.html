						<h3> About </h3>
						Hello! I am originally from <a
							href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Changwon-si,+Gyeongsangnam-do,+South+Korea/@35.249291,128.4006863,11.31z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x356f55bbd3a10527:0x358cad6c407f0f83!8m2!3d35.2028593!4d128.6000923!16zL20vMDJqMDVw?entry=ttu">Changwon</a>,
						a beautiful city in S. Korea, and I came to the US at 16. I moved a lot and experienced diverse
						towns and people while I was in Korea: Changwon, Busan, A-san, Jeju Island, Miryang, and
						Yangsan. I also spent some high school time in Pennsylvania as an exchange student.
						<br> With my personality and growing background, I am a very independent and curious individual
						who loves puzzles. <br>
						I am now a senior studying Computer Science and Mathematics at <a
							href=https://www.mtholyoke.edu> Mount Holyoke College</a> in South Hadley, MA. Also, I am a
						Computer Science PhD applicant for the Fall 2024. <br>
						<br> <b>Research Interest: </b> I am driven to create secure and equitable software
						applications, focusing on enhancing algorithms to ensure universal benefit through ethical and
						responsible data management practices. <br><br>
						<b>TV Show I've Been Into:</b> "Coded Bias", "Hospital Playlist" on Netfix<br>
						<b>My Recommended Book: </b>"Weapons of Math Destructions" by Cathy O'Neil, "Who Moved My
						Cheese?" by Spencer Johnson <br>
						<br><br><br>

										<h3> Notable Projects 📝 </h3>
										<h4>Development of a Recidivism Predicting Model with Lasso Logistic Regression
										</h4>
										COMSC335 Machine Learning, Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA
										<li> Built a recidivism-predicting model using logistic regression, a machine
											learning technique, to predict binary recidivism outcomes. Employed
											collaborative data processing, feature selection, regularizations, and
											hyperparameter tuning alongside two classmates </li> <br>

										<h4>Pulmonary Severity Assessment of Radiography by Artificial Intelligence</h4>
										Veytel.LLC, Pittsburgh, PA
										<li> Implemented an automated severity scoring system of Chest X-Rays to
											diagnose ARDS and Covid-19 in the software engineering internship at Veytel.
											LLC </li>
										<br>

										<h4> University Professor Wage Analysis</h4>
										STAT242 Intermediate Statistics, Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA
										<li> Investigated factors influencing professor wages using data visualizing
											tools in R Studio and an open-source dataset, collaborating with classmates

											<h3> 🌱 Productivity Hacks in My Life 🌱 </h3> <br>
											<li> <b>Regular Sleep Schedule 12 - 6 AM:</b> After a short reflection on how I
												spent the day and tomorrow's plan, I try to go to bed no later than
												midnight for the next day :) </li> <br>
											<li> <b>Morning Exercise: </b> Kicking off a day with a workout refreshes my
												brain and fills me with energy and enthusiasm to tackle the day. </li> <br>
											<li> <b>Me-Time Morning: </b> After the workout, I usually spend 2-3 hours
												in the morning tackling the most complicated tasks (i.e., solving math
												proofs for classes). However, twice a week, with my favorite cup of
												cappuccino from the Nespresso machine, I use this 2-hour morning time
												block for reading books, solving puzzles, or listening to interesting
												podcasts away from my To-do lists and all the assignments.<br> <br>
												<b>Hobbies:</b> Yoga, Weight Training, Cooking, Reading, Traveling <br>
