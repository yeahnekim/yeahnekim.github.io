      <h3> <a href=https://cal.berkeley.edu/cli>Why 6 majors</a> </h3>
      My goal for undergraduate studies was to broadly gain insights into a range of academic fields related to computing, logic, and cognition. I formed multifaceted perspectives on how information is structured in systems, how systems evolve over time, and (human and machine) intelligence in general; I also discovered my passion in computer science and decided to do research in ML.

      <h3> After 2020 </h3>
      After graduating from UC Berkeley, I was an ML research assistant for a few months and a software engineer for a year before joining FAIR in 2022. I had a great experience as a software engineer but decided to pursue a career in research. Starting Fall 2023, I am doing a PhD in CS! <br>
